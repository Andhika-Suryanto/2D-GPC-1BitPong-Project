Hello, my name is Ahn as a Game Developer. This is my first time using README, so please understand if I make some mistakes in my writing. 
I will try to make the description in my project better day by day. Thank you for listening and happy reading the information that I will provide about this project.

Hollow Ping Pong game, is my second game project in Game programming class. 
This project focuses on making games using the Unity application with a 2D Core base, with a little help from PixelArt to make it more satisfying. 
Hollow Ping Pong is a simple Ping Pong game with a Dark Hollow theme that uses some background references from the Hollow Knight game. 
With a dark and mysterious atmosphere, the Ping Pong board will give you a distinctive feeling. 

This game was also developed thanks to learning from the links provided by my GPC Lecturer. 
I am very grateful for that. So in the future, I will attach the references that I used in developing the Hollow Ping Pong Game in this README.

Update, overhauled all project contents into 1 bit Pong. What previously had a hollow theme became a 1 bit game theme.

13/06/2024 - The 1 bit pong project game is already playable. But there are no menu and settings, so there is only a base game that can be run directly.
