## 🔴About
**1 Bit Pong** is my game project in Game Programming Class. This project focuses on making games using the Unity application with a 2D Core base, with a little help from Pixel Art to make it more satisfying. 1 Bit Pong is a simple Pong game with a 1 Bit Dungeon Crawler theme with a dark and mysterious atmosphere and the Ping Pong board will give you a distinctive feeling.
